## About me:
Im learning frontend at Founders and Coders.  I have completed a few bootcamps through encode club and have some experience with JS, HTML, CSS and Solidity.  Ive also started learning some Python.
## Interests
I have spent a lot of time in the web3 universe and have worked for and with a couple of DAOs in the space.  Im interested in web3 in all its forms: crypto, defi, generative art and metaverse/decentralised gaming.  I also enjoy retro game emulation.

Come and say hi! Im always happy to talk about technology, particularly when it related to web3 and AI.  If you fancy popping down the rabbit hole, ask me about AGI or aliens!
