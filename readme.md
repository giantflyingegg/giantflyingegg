## About me:
* Im currently about a year into my coding journey.  I have completed a full stack bootcamp with Founders and Coders and few bootcamps through encode club and developed experience with the OpenAI API, JS, node, HTML, CSS and Solidity.  Since completing the bootcamp I have finshied the CodeAcadamy Python course and have started building using AI models from hugging face, as well as tools such as Ollama, CrewAI, Llamafile and Langchain.  I next would like to learn about training and fine-tuning AI/ML models

## Interests
* I have spent a lot of time in the web3 universe and have worked for and with a couple of DAOs in the space.  Im interested in web3 in all its forms: crypto, desci, defi, DAOs, generative art and metaverse/decentralised gaming.  Im very excited about ZK and have some ideas for privacy minded builds.  I also enjoy retro game emulation and have recently got my Odin2 running and streaming via moonlight from my rig
  
* For 2024 I want to work on my developer skills in the above languages and spend more time on huggingface and AI tools.  Ive helped out building simple robotics tools using RaspberryPi, Arduino abd simple electronics components.  If I get a minute, I also want to build a drone as I have a few ideas for swarming drones using Ardupilot that I would like to try when I dont suck

* Come and say hi! Im always happy to talk about technology, particularly when its related to web3 and AI.  If you fancy popping down the rabbit hole, ask me about AGI or aliens!
