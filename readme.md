## About me:
* I was an NHS doctor for about 10 years, the majority of it spent in an East London teaching hospital. I have a Global health MSc and am interested in the health and healthcare of the developing world

* Im currently about 18 months into my coding journey.  I have completed a full stack bootcamp with Founders and Coders and developed experience with the OpenAI API, JS, node, HTML, CSS and Solidity.  Since completing the bootcamp I have learned Python and finished an Encode Club AI bootcamp.  I have started building using AI models from hugging face, as well as tools such as Ollama, CrewAI, Llamafile and Langchain.  I have also developed experience with front end frameworks and libraries such as React, Bootstrap, NextJS, and TailwindCSS. I have subsequently completed the Encode Club EVM bootcamp and am interested in the nexus of AI and blockchain.

## Interests
* I have spent a lot of time in the web3 universe and have worked for and with a couple of DAOs in the space.  Im interested in web3 in all its forms: crypto, desci, defi, DAOs, generative art and metaverse/decentralised gaming.  Im very excited about ZK and have some ideas for privacy minded builds.  I also enjoy gaming and retro game emulation and have recently got my Odin2 running and streaming via moonlight from my rig
  
* For 2025 I want to work on my developer skills in the above languages and spend more time on huggingface and AI tools.  Ive helped out building simple robotics tools using RaspberryPi, Arduino abd simple electronics components and want to develop my experience in his area also.  If I get a minute, I want to build a drone as I have a few ideas for swarming drones using Ardupilot that I would like to try when I dont suck

* Come and say hi! Im always happy to talk about technology, particularly when its related to web3 and AI.  If you fancy popping down the rabbit hole, ask me about AGI or aliens!
